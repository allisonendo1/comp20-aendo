COMP 20 Spring 2018 Private Repo for Allison Endo

Lab 9 - Learning Portfolio

1. The purpose of this GitHub repository is to provide me with a portfolio of all the work that I've done in this class. 
I can show future employers this repository.

2. My favorite assignment in this class was the very first assignment where we created an online portfolio for ourselves. 
I think that having an online portfolio is very important. As a Human Factors major who is mainly interested in UX Design, 
employers always ask for online portfolios when applying to internships. I do have an existing online portfolio with 
all my design work, but it is on Weebly. This summer, I want to build on my knowledge that I gained from this assignment and
the rest of the course and transfer my portfolio over onto a new platform that I would make myself using HTML/CSS/JS. This
assignment was my favorite because I learned practical skills that I know that I will use.

3. I think one of the main things I have gotten out of this course is a higher confidence in my coding abilities. Prior to
taking this class, the only CS class I had taken at Tufts was COMP 11. I took 11 two years ago, so I was a little 
worried about the two year gap. Honestly, I found 11 pretty challenging, and it kind of scared
me away from CS a bit. However, I decided to pick it back up again because I wanted to learn HTML and CSS. I found that through
this course I gained more confidence in my coding abilities especially when we were working with JS and the server side.

4. I think the most important thing I've learned in this class is how to teach myself and ask for help when needed. For example,
while I was doing assignment 3, I had a lot of syntax-related issues, but I found that I was able to solve most of these
just by looking on StackOverflow. On a similar note, when I came across an issue I couldn't google, I would ask for help from
the TAs. For example, when I was doing assignment 3, I was having some logic issues that I didn't understand, so I went to one
of the TAs and asked for help. In summary, this course made me more comfortable with teaching myself and with asking for help
when I needed it.

5. I would like to delve deeper into the front-end. My main interest is design and making interfaces more usable, so I think it
would be pretty cool to delve deeper into the HTML and CSS side of things. Prior to this class, I just wireframed in Sketch, but
now I know how to take these wireframes and convert them to webpages, and I would like to develop my skills more in this area.
